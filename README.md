The goal of vamplyr is to give you very spooky Dracula vibes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of vamplyr like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("juliasilge/vamplyr")
```

## Example

Maybe you think Bela Lugosi was the best Dracula:

``` r
library(vamplyr)
vamplyr_bela_lugosi()
#> [1] "I never drink... wine."
```

Or maybe you think Gary Oldman was:

``` r
vamplyr_gary_oldman()
#> [1] " Listen to them: the children of the night. What sweet music they make."
```
